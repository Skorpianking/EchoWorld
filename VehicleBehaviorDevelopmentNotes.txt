Options:

a) write a GotoHome() behavior
 - pro: easy
 - con: should really use GotoX(Home)
        result can be a flat tree

b) write a Holding() behavior that votes high when holding
 - pro: easy
        would result in a fusion node over the GotoX(Home) behavior so 2 subtrees
 - con: not really a behavior more like a signal or condition behavior
 
c) Add composites (Selector, Sequencer) based on video game behavior trees
 reminders: Sequencer - run each node in turn until full success of all or failure of one
    Selector - run each child in order until one runs successfully Running while one of the child nodes runs. Not sure why called selector, because it executes the nodes in order.
	The also include conditional leaves (like the 'Holding()' behavior in b.
 - pro: extends behavior framework to include the current hot programming behavior based system
 - con: Success, Failure, Running message returns (not action + vote return) or a real cludge 
     still has a condition behavior
 
d) Add a Sequencer
 - pro: Moves us closer to a full robot control architecture
        Allows for extending domain complexity and engages conditionals into the Vehicle behavior
 - con: Additional JSON parsing for (Sequence with Trees and Signals)
        Code for the sequencer and signals
		Trees won't be very complex because some of the complexity moves into the Sequencer
		
e) A fusion of c & d
   Add a 'Sequencer' behavior that executes sub-trees in order and a 'Signal' leaf that are conditionals on state data (if ~Holding then execute)
   Alternate implementation: just make a 'Conditional' behavior (JSON parsing could be messy) That takes the input from a sub-tree and checks it against a tree or step sequence.
 -pro: Gets us the missing Behavior Tree structure
         more complex trees
 -con: There is a choice to be made, and then some fiddling with the best design structure (single conditional, case, how to handle a full chain sequence, do we include plan repair like a real sequencer, ...)
