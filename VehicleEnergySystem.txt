World Size in pixels: 1200 x 600           SimulationFrame constructor
Scale (pixels per meter): 12          // already exposed in world JSON file
Tick: 50 ms or 20 Hz

Vehicle start energy = 100.0          // Home.Step() and JSONVehicle.treeFromJSON()
Vehicle energy decay: energyUsage * 0.0025 : energyUsage = \Sum_{1}^{behavior tree size} 0.25 \\in Vehicle.sense()
         Agent 4 has 12 behavior nodes and so energyUsage = 3
		 decay ends up at 0.0075 per tick

 FOOD_ENERGY = 35                     // Vehicles.java
 ENERGY_REWARD = 10
 ENERGY_REWARD_MAX = 20
 ENERGY_REWARD_STEP = 1000
Drop off:                             // Vehicles CustomStepListener.end()
   Vehicle reward: ENERGY_REWARD = 10 + 1 every ENERGY_REWARD_STEP ticks capped at ENERGY_REWARD_MAX
   Home receives FOOD_ENERGY - ENERGY_REWARD
   
Agent Spawn    // Home.Step()
  Home energy > 100.0
    Create new Agent with energy 100.0
    Home energy = home energy - 50.0     <==== THIS INCREASES SYSTEM ENERGY
  Home energy decay = 0.0
  
Food Spawn
 MAX_FOODLIST_COUNT = 20          <===== Means that food energy is capped at 20 * 35 = 700
 food_spawn_timer = 200 (ticks)      // already exposed in world JSON file
 starts with 2 locations and 2 food  // already exposed in world JSON file
 
Food Spawn Locations
  Currently 14.2m from home - no obstacles // already exposed in world JSON file
  
Vehicle top speed: 5 // Vehicle.java
 From the logs it looks like this is 1.08 m/s
 0.054 each tick, 20 hz = 0.054*20 = 1.08
 -- Looks like the deltaPosition field can't be relied upon. There are some values that are very large periodically.
